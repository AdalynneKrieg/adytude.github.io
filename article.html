<h2>Bluegrass News</h2>
  <h4>Uno Reverse? </h4>
 <p>Local resident Mildred McStuffins, 83, lives alone in her house on Bluegrass Dr. To the amazement and concern of her neighbors,<br/>
    they discovered Mildred sitting up in a tree about 7 feet off the ground. Emergency services were immediately <br/>
    contacted, but upon returning to Mildred, it was discovered that they were no longer needed. One of Mildredâ€™s many cats, <br/>
    lovingly named Chub, appeared to have somehow gotten Mildred down safely. No injuries have been sustained, and Chub was <br/>
    given many treats and pets to thank him for his assistance!

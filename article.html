                Local resident Mildred McStuffins, 83, lives alone in her house on Bluegrass Dr. To the amazement and concern of her neighbors,<br/>
                they discovered Mildred sitting up in a tree about 7 feet off the ground. Emergency services were immediately contacted, but <br/>
                upon returning to Mildred, it was discovered that they were no longer needed. </p>
                
            <p>
                One of Mildred’s many cats, lovingly named Chub, appeared to have somehow gotten Mildred down safely. In an exclusive interview <br/>
                with the granny-saver himself, Chub reveals his past work as a stunt actor, having had years of safety training under his belt. <br/>
                When asked about his most dangerous stunt, Chub replied;
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Meow meow meow, <strong>meow</strong> meow! Meow meow meow meow meow, meowww!</q> No injuries have been sustained, <br/>
                and sources say Chub was awarded an entire deboned cod filet for his assistance.
